# Node Cleaner

A curses-based terminal application that scans all folders in the working directory for node modules folders.

This cleaned up about 30gb of space off of my computer!

Only uses native packages, so you're completely fine to just run it with python3.

I am no expert on TUI and wrote this in a few hours, so feel free to leave issues if any problems arise. 

**Make sure to back up anything that is incredibly important. This has not been widely tested, and remains untested on anything but MacOS.**

Mark for deletion with space bar. use j and k to go up and down or arrow keys if you are lame like that.
